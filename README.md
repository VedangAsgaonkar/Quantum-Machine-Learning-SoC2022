# Quantum-Machine-Learning-SoC2022
Repository for "An Introduction to QC, ML and QML" as a part of WnCC SoC '22. Mentors: [Siddhant Midha](https://github.com/siddhant-midha) and [Vedang Asgaonkar](github.com/VedangAsgaonkar)

## Description
The project will begin with an introduction to quantum computing :atom: . The main reference book for this part will be Quantum Computing and Quantum Information by Nielsen and Chuang. We will also learn to create quantum circuits using IBM's qiskit package embedded in python. This will be followed by implementation
of some algorithms in qiskit.

Subsequently, we will shift our focus to machine learning ðŸ§  . Depending upon the mentee's prior experience, we will provide theoretical reading material as well as practical models for implementation. This may range from simple regression and SVM to fully connected networks and probably even CNNs.

Finally, we will come to the crux of our project; quantum machine learning. The mentee will get to choose one or more papers on QML from a fixed collection and implement them. To that end, we will use QML libraries like Tensorflow Quantum or PennyLane.

## Checkpoints
* Introduction to QC and linear algebra
* Quantum Circuits. Introduction to Qiskit
* QFT and Grover's search. Implementation in Qiskit
* Fundamentals of machine learning
* Practical models in machine learning
* Introduction to Tensorflow Quantum/ Pennylane
* Implementation of a QML paper

## Review mechanism
Every week we will have some code/report that the mentees need to turn in. This will be specified on a weekly basis. Mentees need to maintain their own github repos for the project, with folders for each week. All the code and reports will be put into these folders.

## Evaluation
There will be two evaluations, one for the QC part and one for the QML part. 
* QC Evaluation: There are four questions. Attempting any two is compulsary. Attempt any three to get a bonus. Attempt any four to get a bigger bonus. [^1]
* QML Evaluation: TBA.
## Feedback
Feedback for the project will be through the Whatsapp group



[^1]: Bonus points will be awarded in the final evaluation and you will get to learn something new.
