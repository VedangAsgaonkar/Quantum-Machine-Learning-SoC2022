# Tasks For Week 1

This week we shall be diving into quantum computation. This will be done by first getting a general introduction to the world of QC, and looking at how it is different from its classical counterparts. Then, the basic mathematics will be covered.

We shall use the book Quantum Computation and Quantum Information by Michael Nielson and Isaac Chuang (hereon abbreviated as QCQI) as our primary reference. 

Reading material for week one:
1. Introductary reading: Pages 13-36 from QCQI
2. Mathematical Background: Pages 61-86 from QCQI

Some _optional_ reading material, for better understanding:
- John Preskill's introductary notes: http://theory.caltech.edu/~preskill/ph229/notes/chap1.pdf
- An online essay, by Andy Matuschak and Michael Nielsen: https://quantum.country/qcvc
- Introductary notes from Berkeley's QIC course: https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs191/fa10/notes/chap1&2.pdf
