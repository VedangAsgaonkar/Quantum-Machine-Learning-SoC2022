# The last dance with QCQI

This week's content will be the last encounter we have with the book in this project, so do read the required sections carefully :)
## Reading
We shall first cover quantum fourier transforms. Then we will see the applications of the same in phase estimation and order finding (key to the famous Shor's Algorithm!). 
This will be done from the pages 216-235. 

Then, we shall explore quantum search (Grover's Algorithms!) and quantum simulations from the pages 248 - 261.
## Implementation 
Finally, you are expected to perform the following implementations on qiskit.

1. Quantum Fourier Transforms
2. Quantum Phase Estimation
3. Shor's Algorithm
4. Grover's Algorithm

Trying them yourself is encouraged, but you can refer to the [Qiskit Notebooks](https://qiskit.org/textbook/what-is-quantum.html).
