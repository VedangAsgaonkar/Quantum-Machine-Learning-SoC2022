# Week 2
This week's focus will be on using basic gates to create quantum circuits. The reading material for this week is pages 171-197 of QCQI.

 It will give a complete procedure of constructing any quantum operator from two qubit gates. You will also go over the decomposition of two qubit gates to  a combination of one qubit gates and CNOT gates. Finally we can approximate one qubit gates with Hadamard, phase and pi/8 gates as closely as we wish, establishing the universality of these gates. We will also deal with measurement and representation of classical circuits as quantum circuits. Quite a lot of stuff for 28 pages :)

This will be complemented by coding exercises in Qiskit. The instructions for these can be found [here](Coding.md). 

Finally, when you are done with the reading material, you can read this [summary of quantum circuits](https://github.com/VedangAsgaonkar/Quantum-Computing-SoC-2021/blob/main/quantum%20circuits%20summary.pdf) to wash it all down.
